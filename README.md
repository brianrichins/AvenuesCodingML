# Machine Learning with Python and Jupyter Notebooks

This tutorial from Max Taggart is a hands-on introduction to the concepts of Machine Learning. It uses a simple  data set (age, height, weight, gender) to create a gender prediction model.

You may wish to take notes on the concepts within your local copy of the notebook as you follow along during the workshop.

## Prerequisites

Install the following on your laptop before starting:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) - a popular cross-platform Python/R machine learning install that includes Python and Jupyter Notebooks  

  or

- [Python (2.7 or 3.3+)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

Also the following Python libraries (e.g. via  `pip`). Windows users may need to add their Python install to their `PATH` to run Python commands from a terminal.

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`

You may also want to verify and test your install by [running the notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running).
